# Deployment Topologies

Pinecall agents are just Node.js processes. Where you run them is your choice. There are three common topologies — each is valid, each has tradeoffs.

## The fundamental split

Before topology, understand the two communication patterns:

**1. Backend channels** — phone, SIP, WhatsApp. These talk to your Node.js process via the SDK's WebSocket. Your code receives events through an in-process EventEmitter.

**2. Browser channels** — WebRTC and chat. The browser connects **directly** to `voice.pinecall.io`. Your backend's only job is minting short-lived tokens.

This split is why some topologies support SSE event streaming and others don't — SSE requires the agent to be in the same process as your web server.

## Topology 1: Embedded

Agent runs inside your existing web app (Express, Next.js, Hono, Remix). The web server and the agent share a Node.js process.

![Embedded topology](/assets/diagrams/deployment-embedded.png)

**Pros:**
- SSE streaming works (you can build live dashboards)
- One deployment unit — easy ops
- Token endpoint is one route away from the agent

**Cons:**
- The agent process restarts every time you deploy the web app
- Web traffic and voice traffic share resources

**When to use:** small apps, dashboards that need live call event streaming, single-team projects.

## Topology 2: Standalone

Agent runs as a separate process from your web app. The web app handles HTTP, the agent process handles voice.

![Standalone topology](/assets/diagrams/deployment-standalone.png)

**Pros:**
- Independent deploys — restart the agent without touching the web app
- Independent scaling — give the agent its own resources
- Crash isolation — a web bug doesn't kill calls in flight

**Cons:**
- No SSE — the web app can't stream events from the agent process directly. If you need live dashboards, the agent has to expose its own SSE endpoint or push to a shared bus (Redis, NATS).
- Two deployments to manage

**When to use:** higher-traffic apps, when ops cares about independent scaling, when you want to avoid the "web deploy kills in-flight calls" problem.

## Topology 3: Headless

No web server at all. Just the agent. Use this when you only need phone/SIP/WhatsApp — no browser channels, no dashboards, no tokens to mint.

```typescript
// agent/index.js — a complete production agent, no web server needed
import { Pinecall } from "@pinecall/sdk";

const pc = new Pinecall();

export const agent = pc.agent("support", {
  prompt: "You are a support agent for an online store...",
  llm: "openai/gpt-5-chat-latest",
  voice: "elevenlabs/sarah",
  stt: "deepgram/flux",
  language: "en",
  phoneNumber: "+13186330963",
  greeting: "Hi! How can I help?",
  tools: [lookupOrder, processReturn],
});
```

Run it with `pinecall run agent/index.js` for a polished boot banner and live transcript.

**Pros:**
- Lowest possible complexity
- No HTTP surface to attack or maintain
- Easy to ship as a container, a systemd unit, or a serverless function

**Cons:**
- No browser channels (no WebRTC, no chat) unless someone else mints tokens
- No SSE
- No dashboards from this process

**When to use:** IoT devices, intercoms, single-purpose phone bots, WhatsApp-only bots, scheduled outbound campaigns.

## Comparison

| Feature | Embedded | Standalone | Headless |
|---|---|---|---|
| SSE (`agent.stream()`) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| WebRTC / Chat | ✅ | ✅ (token from web app) | ❌ (or you build it) |
| Phone / SIP | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| WhatsApp | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Outbound calls | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Operational complexity | Medium | Medium | **Lowest** |
| Independent scaling | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Crash isolation | ❌ | ✅ | n/a |

## Which one should you pick?

- **Just starting out** — embedded. Get something running, split later if you need to.
- **You need browser channels and a dashboard** — embedded.
- **You're scaling and ops cares** — standalone.
- **You're shipping a fixed-purpose device or WhatsApp-only bot** — headless.

Migration between topologies is cheap. The agent code is the same in all three. You're just choosing where to run it.

- [Dev mode](/guides/dev-mode) — run prod and dev agents on the same phone number
- [SSE streaming reference](/reference/events) — for embedded dashboards
