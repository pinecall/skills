# Quickstart

Get a Pinecall voice agent answering calls in under 5 minutes.

## 1. Install

```bash
npm install @pinecall/sdk
```

> Node.js ≥ 18. The only runtime dependency is `ws`.

## 2. Get an API key

Sign up at [pinecall.io](https://pinecall.io), grab your API key from the dashboard, and export it:

```bash
export PINECALL_API_KEY=pk_...
```

## 3. Create your agent

Create `agent/index.js`:

```typescript
import { Pinecall } from "@pinecall/sdk";

const pc = new Pinecall();

export const agent = pc.agent("mara", {
  prompt: "You are Mara, a friendly voice assistant. Be concise.",
  llm: "openai/gpt-5-chat-latest",
  voice: "elevenlabs/sarah",
  stt: "deepgram/flux",
  language: "en",
  greeting: "Hello! How can I help?",
});
```

## 4. Run it

```bash
pinecall run agent/index.js
```

You should see:

```
  ⚡ booting mara  ·  gpt-5-chat-latest · elevenlabs/sarah
  ☎ listening (no phone — webrtc/chat only)
```

That's a running voice agent. It's connected to Pinecall's voice server, it has a personality, and it's waiting for someone to call.

## 5. Talk to it

The fastest way to test your agent — chat from the terminal:

```bash
pinecall chat mara
```

```
  ⚡ Connected to mara

  you › What can you help me with?
  mara › I can help with all sorts of things! What do you need?
```

This uses the same LLM, prompt, and tools as a voice call — just over text.

### From the browser

For voice, connect from the browser using the [`@pinecall/web`](https://github.com/pinecall/web):

```bash
npm install @pinecall/web
```

```tsx
import { VoiceWidget } from "@pinecall/web";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <VoiceWidget
      agent="mara"
      tokenProvider={async () => {
        const res = await fetch("/api/token");
        return res.json();
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

You'll need a tiny backend endpoint to mint the token:

```typescript
app.get("/api/token", async (req, res) => {
  const token = await mara.createToken("webrtc");
  res.json(token);
});
```

Click the widget, talk to Mara. She'll respond.

## What just happened

You created an agent (`mara`), gave her a personality, and connected a browser to her via WebRTC. The server handles STT (you speak → text), runs the LLM (text → response), and handles TTS (response → voice). WebRTC works automatically via tokens — no channel declaration needed.

You didn't write a single line of WebSocket code, audio handling, or VAD logic. The SDK and the Pinecall server handle all of that.

## Add a phone number

Want Mara to answer phone calls too? Add `phoneNumber`:

```typescript
const mara = pc.agent("mara", {
  // ...same as before
  phoneNumber: "+13186330963",
});
```

Now the same agent serves browser **and** phone calls. The events are identical — your code doesn't need to know which transport the call came in over.

### Multiple numbers with per-number config

Use `phoneNumbers` (plural) to attach multiple numbers with per-number overrides — ideal for A/B testing, multi-language support, or regional routing:

```typescript
const mara = pc.agent("mara", {
  prompt: "You are Mara, a friendly voice assistant.",
  llm: "openai/gpt-5-chat-latest",
  phoneNumbers: [
    // US number: English, fast native turns
    { number: "+14155551234", language: "en", stt: "deepgram/flux", voice: "elevenlabs/sarah" },
    // Saudi number: Arabic, requires Nova (Flux doesn't support Arabic)
    { number: "+966501234567", language: "ar", stt: "deepgram/nova-3", voice: "elevenlabs/ahmad" },
    // Simple — just a number, inherits agent defaults
    "+13186330963",
  ],
});
```

Each number can override `language`, `stt`, `voice`, and `ringing`. The agent prompt, LLM, and tools stay the same — only the voice interface changes per number. This lets you test different STT providers, voices, or languages on the same agent without deploying separate instances.

## Add a tool

Tools are local functions with Zod schemas — auto-executed by the SDK:

```typescript
import { Pinecall, tool } from "@pinecall/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

const lookupOrder = tool({
  name: "lookupOrder",
  description: "Look up an order by ID",
  schema: z.object({ orderId: z.string() }),
  execute: async ({ orderId }) => await db.orders.findOne(orderId),
});

const mara = pc.agent("mara", {
  prompt: "You are Mara. Look up orders when asked.",
  llm: "openai/gpt-5-chat-latest",
  voice: "elevenlabs/sarah",
  stt: "deepgram/flux",
  language: "en",
  greeting: "Hello! How can I help?",
  tools: [lookupOrder],
});
```

No webhook URL to expose. No manual event handler. Just a function that runs in your process.
