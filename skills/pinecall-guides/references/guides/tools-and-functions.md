# Tools and Functions

Tools are how your agent moves beyond conversation into action: looking up an order, checking inventory, booking a slot, transferring to a human. In Pinecall, tools are **local functions in your process**, not webhooks.

## Defining tools

Use the `tool()` helper with a Zod schema. Tools are auto-executed by the SDK when the LLM calls them — no manual event handler needed.

```typescript
import { Pinecall, tool } from "@pinecall/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

const lookupOrder = tool({
  name: "lookupOrder",
  description: "Look up an order by its ID.",
  schema: z.object({
    orderId: z.string().describe("The order ID, like ORD-12345"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ orderId }) => {
    return await db.orders.findOne(orderId);
  },
});

const scheduleCallback = tool({
  name: "scheduleCallback",
  description: "Schedule a callback for a specific date and time.",
  schema: z.object({
    datetime: z.string().describe("ISO 8601 datetime"),
    reason: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ datetime, reason }, call) => {
    return await scheduler.book({
      phone: call.from,
      datetime,
      reason,
    });
  },
});

const agent = pc.agent("support", {
  prompt: "You are a helpful support agent. Use tools to look up information.",
  llm: "openai/gpt-5-chat-latest",
  voice: "elevenlabs/sarah",
  stt: "deepgram/flux",
  language: "en",
  tools: [lookupOrder, scheduleCallback],
});

agent.on("call.started", (call) => call.say("Hi, how can I help?"));
```

That's it. When the LLM decides to call `lookupOrder`, the SDK:

1. Parses the arguments through `z.object({ orderId: z.string() })`
2. Calls your `execute` function with the validated args + the `Call` object
3. Sends the result back to the LLM via `call.toolResult()`

## Tool call lifecycle

![Tool call lifecycle](/assets/diagrams/tool-call-lifecycle.png)

## Ephemeral tools (don't persist the result)

By default every tool result is saved to the conversation history — it stays in
the LLM context for the rest of the call and is written to the persisted
transcript. That's almost always what you want.

Sometimes it isn't. A tool might return a sensitive lookup (a full customer
record, a one-time code) or a large/noisy payload (a 5 KB JSON blob) that you
need *for the current reply* but don't want lingering in context or saved to the
database. Mark such a tool `ephemeral: true`:

```typescript
const lookupSSN = tool({
  name: "lookupSSN",
  description: "Look up the caller's SSN to verify identity.",
  schema: z.object({ customerId: z.string() }),
  ephemeral: true, // result is used for this reply, then dropped from history
  execute: async ({ customerId }) => ({ ssn: await db.getSSN(customerId) }),
});
```

How it works: the result is still sent to the model so it can generate the
current reply (the API requires every tool call to be followed by its result).
But once that reply is produced, the server **prunes** the ephemeral result —
and the originating `tool_calls` entry if all of its calls were ephemeral — from
the history. It never reaches the next turn's context and is never written to
the saved transcript. The behavior is identical across voice, chat, and
WhatsApp.

`ephemeral` defaults to `false`, so existing tools are unchanged.

## The `call` parameter

Every `execute` function receives the `Call` object as its second argument. Use it to interact with the call mid-tool-execution:

```typescript
const transferToHuman = tool({
  name: "transferToHuman",
  description: "Escalate to a human agent.",
  schema: z.object({
    department: z.enum(["sales", "support", "billing"]),
  }),
  execute: async ({ department }, call) => {
    const numbers = {
      sales: "+15551110000",
      support: "+15551110001",
      billing: "+15551110002",
    };
    call.say("Of course, let me connect you to a specialist.");
    call.forward(numbers[department]);
    return { transferred: true };
  },
});
```

## Why local functions beat webhooks

Other platforms make tools webhook URLs. You define a tool, expose a public endpoint, the platform POSTs to it. The downsides pile up fast:

- **You expose a public endpoint** — attack surface, rate limiting, auth headaches
- **You can't reach internal services** — your DB, your Redis, your hardware
- **Latency** — every tool call is a network roundtrip across the public internet
- **Debuggability** — tool call goes out, response comes back, what happened in between?

Pinecall tools run in your process. That means:

- `await db.query(...)` works directly
- `await redis.get(...)` works directly
- `await hardware.openDoor()` works directly (if your process can reach it)
- Stack traces, breakpoints, and logs work normally
- No public surface to attack
- Sub-millisecond "call" overhead — it's a function call, not an HTTP request

## Common patterns

### Database lookups

```typescript
const findCustomer = tool({
  name: "findCustomer",
  description: "Find a customer by phone number or email.",
  schema: z.object({
    query: z.string().describe("Phone or email"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ query }) => {
    const customer = await db.customers.find({
      or: [{ phone: query }, { email: query }],
    });
    return customer ?? { error: "not_found" };
  },
});
```

### Transfer to human

```typescript
const transferToHuman = tool({
  name: "transferToHuman",
  description: "Escalate to a human agent when the customer is angry or has a complex issue.",
  schema: z.object({
    department: z.enum(["sales", "support", "billing"]),
  }),
  execute: async ({ department }, call) => {
    const numbers = { sales: "+15551110000", support: "+15551110001", billing: "+15551110002" };
    call.say("Of course, let me connect you to a specialist.");
    call.forward(numbers[department]);
    return { transferred: true };
  },
});
```

### Booking / scheduling

```typescript
const bookAppointment = tool({
  name: "bookAppointment",
  description: "Book an appointment in the doctor's calendar.",
  schema: z.object({
    datetime: z.string().describe("ISO 8601 datetime"),
    durationMinutes: z.number(),
    patientName: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ datetime, durationMinutes, patientName }) => {
    const slot = await calendar.book({
      start: new Date(datetime),
      duration: durationMinutes,
      patient: patientName,
    });
    return slot.success
      ? { booked: true, confirmationId: slot.id }
      : { booked: false, error: slot.conflictReason };
  },
});
```

### End the call

```typescript
const endCall = tool({
  name: "endCall",
  description: "End the call when the customer says goodbye.",
  schema: z.object({}),
  execute: async (_, call) => {
    call.say("Have a great day!");
    call.once("bot.finished", () => call.hangup());
    return { ended: true };
  },
});
```

## Returning errors

If a tool call fails, the SDK catches the error and returns `{ error: err.message }` to the LLM automatically. The LLM can then recover (apologize, retry, ask clarifying questions).

You can also return errors explicitly:

```typescript
const lookupOrder = tool({
  name: "lookupOrder",
  description: "Look up an order by ID.",
  schema: z.object({ orderId: z.string() }),
  execute: async ({ orderId }) => {
    const order = await db.orders.findOne(orderId);
    if (!order) return { error: "Order not found" };
    return order;
  },
});
```

## Listening to tool calls (optional)

The `llm.toolCall` event still fires for every tool call — useful for logging, metrics, or UI:

```typescript
agent.on("llm.toolCall", (data, call) => {
  console.log(`Tools called: ${data.toolCalls.map(t => t.name).join(", ")}`);
});
```

## Tools work across all channels

The same tools work for phone, WebRTC, chat, and WhatsApp. The `Call` object is your interface regardless of transport.

## What's next

- [Hot-reload](/concepts/hot-reload) — change the prompt or tools mid-call
- [Events reference](/reference/events) — all events including `llm.toolCall`
- [`Call` API reference](/api/call) — `forward`, `hangup`, etc.
